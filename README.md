# Bot Against Humanity
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBoesen/BotAgainstHumanity.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBoesen/BotAgainstHumanity)

> Bot Against Humanity allows members of GroupMe chats to virtually play everyone's favorite party game for terrible people.

## Motivation
Bot Against Humanity grew out of [Yalebot](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/Yalebot), a bot designed for Yale University's GroupMe chats. Yalebot is a very complex bot with several hundred features, of which Cards Against Humanity was only one. The card game did not fit well into the existing modular infrastructure of Yalebot due to the need for interaction through the chat, a web interface, and websockets. In addition, it was relevant to a wider market than Yale students. Yalebot's CAH functionality was thus spun off into this bot.

## Platform
Bot Against Humanity runs best on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). Simply push the code via Heroku CLI and the bot will launch.
